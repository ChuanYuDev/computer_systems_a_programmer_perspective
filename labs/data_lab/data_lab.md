# Data Lab
## Introduction
- Students implement simple logical, two's complement, and floating point functions, but using a highly restricted subset of C
    - For example, they might be asked to compute the absolute value of a number using only bit-level operations and straightline code

- This lab helps students understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior of the operations on data.
