## Introduction
- At CMU we use this lab in place of the Performance Lab
- Students write a general-purpose cache simulator, and then optimize a small matrix transpose kernel to minimize the number of misses on a simulated cache
- Learn how the memory hierarchy works and how to exploit it

- This lab uses the Valgrind tool to generate address traces

- Note: This lab must be run on a 64-bit x86-64 system
