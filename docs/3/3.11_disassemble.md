# Practice Problem 3.11 (solution page 329)
It is common to find assembly-code lines of the form

```
xorq %rdx, %rdx
```
in code that was generated from C where no `EXCLUSIVE-OR` operations were present.

A. Explain the effect of this particular `EXCLUSIVE-OR` instruction and what useful operation it implements.

B. What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in assembly code?

C. Compare the number of bytes to encode these two different implementations of the same operation.

### Solutions:

- A. set `%rdx` to 0 since `x ^ x = 0`
- B. `movq $0, %rdx`
- C. assemble and disassemble 3.11.c program
    - `xorq %rsi,%rdi`: 3 bytes
    - `movq	$-15790321, %rax`: 7 bytes
    - Relying on the convention, adopted in x86-64, any instruction generates a 32-bit for a register also sets the high-order portion of the register to 0
    - `xorl %ecx, %edx`: 2 bytes
    - `movl $0, %eax`: 5 bytes
