# Cache Lab
- Aim:
    - In place of the performance lab
    - Build a cache simulator
    - Make a small transpose function run with a few misses as possible
    - Learn how the memory hierarchy works and how to exploit it
    - Use the valgrind tool to generate real address traces for the matrix transpose kernel
