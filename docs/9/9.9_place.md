# Practice Problem 9.9 (solution page 884)
Implement a `place` function for the example allocator.

```c
static void place(void *bp, size_t asize)
```

Your solution should place the requested block at the beginning of the free block, splitting only if the size of the remainder would equal or exceed the minimum block size.
