# Practice Problem 2.22
solution page 150

Show that each of the following bit vectors is a two's-complement representation of -5 by applying Equation 2.3:

A. [1011]

B. [11011]

C. [111011]

Observe that the second and third bit vectors can be derived from the first by sign extension.

## Solution:
A. [1011]: $-2^3 + 2 + 2^0 = -5$

B. [11011]: $-2^4 + 2^3 + 2 + 2^0 = -2^3 + 2 + 2^0 = -5$

C. [111011]: $-2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2 + 2^0 = -2^4 + 2^3 + 2 + 2^0 = -5$
