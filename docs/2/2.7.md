# Practice Problem 2.7 
Solution page 145

What would be printed as a result of the following call to `show_bytes`?

```c
const char *s = "abcdef";
show_bytes((byte_pointer) s, strlen(s));
```

Note that letters `a` through `z` have ASCII codes `0x61` through `0x7A`.

## Solution:
A string in C is encoded by an array of characters terminated by the null (having value 0) character.

`s` is the pointer having the address of `a`

`show_bytes` will print `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` hexadecimal representations.

Print: `61 62 63 64 65 66`
