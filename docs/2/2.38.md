# Practice Problem 2.38 (solution page 155)
As we will see in Chapter 3, the `LEA` instruction can perform computations of the form `(a<<k) + b`, where `k` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `b` is either 0 or some program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute `3*a` as (a<<1) + a.

Considering cases where `b` is either 0 or equal to `a`, and all possible values of `k`, what multiples of `a` can be computed with a single `LEA` instruction?
