# Practice Problem 1.2 
Solution page 28 $\checkmark$

The marketing department at your company has promised your customers that the next software release will show a 2x performance improvement. You have been assigned the task of delivering on that promise. You have determined that only 80% of the system can be improved. How much (i.e., what value of k) would you need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target?

## Solution:
$\alpha = 0.8$

$S = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha + \alpha / k} = 2$

$k = 2.67$
