# Practice Problem 12.10 (solution page 1038)
The solution to the first readers-writers problem in Figure 12.26 gives priority to readers, but this priority is weak in the sense that a writer leaving its critical section might restart a waiting writer instead of a waiting reader. Describe a scenario where this weak priority would allow a collection of writers to starve a reader.

## Solution:
- Suppose that a particular semaphore implementation uses a LIFO stack of threads for each semaphore
- When a thread blocks on a semaphore in a `P` operation, its ID is pushed onto the stack
- Similarly, the `V` operation pops the top thread ID from the stack and restarts that thread
- Given this stack implementation, an adversarial writer in its critical section could simply wait until another writer blocks on the semaphore before releasing the semaphore
- In this scenario, a waiting reader might wait forever as two writers passed control back and forth
- Notice that although it might seem more intuitive to use a FIFO queue rather than a LIFO stack, using such a stack is not incorrect and does not violate the semantics of the `P` and `V` operations
