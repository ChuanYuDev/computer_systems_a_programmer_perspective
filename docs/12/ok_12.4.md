# Practice Problem 12.4 (solution page 1036)
In the server in Figure 12.8, we are careful to reinitialize the `pool.ready_set` variable immediately before every call to `select`. Why?

## Solution:
- Because `select` function will modify `pool.ready_set` from read set to ready set
- `pool.ready_set` serves as both an input and output argument
    - On input, it contains the read set
    - On output, it contains the ready set
- After `add_client` and `check_clients`, we get new active descriptors stored in `pool.read_set`
- Hence we reinitialize `pool.ready_set` to read set for the `select` argument
