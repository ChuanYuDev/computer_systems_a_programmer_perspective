# Practice Problem 12.13 (solution page 1039)
In Figure 12.43, we might be tempted to free the allocated memory block immediately after line 14 in the main thread, instead of freeing it in the peer thread. But this would be a bad idea. Why?

## Solution:
- If the main thread executes the free instructions before the peer thread reads the argument, `myid` variable may reference undefined value
- We will introduce a new race, this time between the call to `free` in the main thread and the assignment statement in line 24 of the thread routine
