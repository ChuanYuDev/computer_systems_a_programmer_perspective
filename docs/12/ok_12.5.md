# Practice Problem 12.5 (solution page 1036)
In the process-based server in Figure 12.5, we were careful to close the connected descriptor in two places: the parent process and the child process. However, in the threads-based server in Figure 12.14, we only closed the connected descriptor in one place: the peer thread. Why?

## Solution:
- Because threads share the process virtual space including open files
- There is only one copy of descriptor table entry instead of two in the parent and child processes
- So closing the connected descriptor in the peer thread is enough to release the data structure of the open file
