# Practice Problem 3.11
solution page 329

It is common to find assembly-code lines of the form

`xorq %rdx,%rdx`

in code that was generated from C where no EXCLUSIVE-OR operations were present.

- A. Explain the effect of this particular EXCLUSIVE-OR instruction and what useful operation it implements.
- B. What would be the more straightforward way to express this operation in assembly code?
- C. Compare the number of bytes to encode these two different implementaÂ­tions of the same operation.

### Solutions:
```
gcc -Og -c problems/3.11.c
linux> objdump -d 3.11.o
