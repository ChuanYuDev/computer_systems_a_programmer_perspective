Practice Problem 6.18 (solution page 666)
The heart of the recent hit game Sim Aquarium is a tight loop that calculates the average position of 256 algae. You are evaluating its cache performance on a
machine with a 1,024-byte direct-mapped data cache with 16-byte blocks (B = 16).
You are given the following definitions:
2
3
struct algae_position {
int x;
int yï¼›
6
7
};
struct algae_position grid[16] [16] ;
int total_x = 0, total_y = 0;
int i, j;
You should also assume the following:
*   sizeof(int)= 4.
*   grid begins at memory address 0.
*   The cache is initially empty.
  The only memory accesses are to the entries of the array grid. Variables i, j, total_x, and total-y are stored in registers.
