# Practice Problem 12.12 (solution page 1038)
The `ctime_ts` function in Figure 12.38 is thread-safe but not reentrant. Explain.

## Solution:
- Thread-safe:
    - It uses lock-and-copy technique to code a thread-safe wrapper function for the `ctime` function
    - The accesses to the shared variable are protected by `P` and `V` operations and thus are mutually exclusive

- Not reentrant:
    - Because it references the same `static` shared variable return by the `ctime` function
