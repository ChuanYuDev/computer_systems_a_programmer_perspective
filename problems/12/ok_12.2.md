# Practice Problem 12.2 (solution page 1036)
If we were to delete line 30 of Figure 12.5, which closes the connected descriptor, the code would still be correct, in the sense that there would be no memory leak. Why?

## Solution:
- Because after the child process terminates, the kernel would close all the open ~~files~~ descriptors
- The child's copy of the connected file descriptor will be closed automatically when the child exits
