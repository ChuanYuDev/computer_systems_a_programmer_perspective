# Practice Problem 12.3 (solution page 1036)
In Linux systems, typing Ctrl+D indicates `EOF` on standard input. What happens if you type Ctrl+D to the program in Figure 12.6 while it is blocked in the call to `select`?

## Solution:
- ~~Nothing happens, `select` function still blocks the process, because `EOF` doesn't mean the standard input is ready for reading~~ 

- A descriptor $k$ is **ready for reading** if and only if a request to read 1 byte from that descriptor would not block
- If typing Ctrl+D indicates `EOF` on standard input, the descriptor is ready for reading because the `read` function will return 0 immediately

- Therefore, `select` will return descriptor `STDIN_FILENO` in ready set
