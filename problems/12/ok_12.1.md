# Practice Problem 12.1 (solution page 1036)
After the parent closes the connected descriptor in line 33 of the concurrent server in Figure 12.5, the child is still able to communicate with the client using its copy of the descriptor. Why?

## Solution:
- Closing the file descriptor only ~~decreases~~ decrements the reference count of the ~~open~~ file table entry
- The child process file descriptor prevents the ~~open~~ file table entry reference count from going to 0
- Since the kernel will not close a file until the reference counter in its file table goes to 0, the child's end of the connection stays open
