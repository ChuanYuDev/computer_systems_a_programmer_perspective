# Practice Problem 12.14 (solution page 1039)

A. In Figure 12.43, we eliminated the race by allocating a separate block for each integer ID. Outline a different approach that does not call the `malloc` or `free` functions.

B. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?

## Solution:

- A. Directly pass `i` value to the argument pointer

    ~~`13  Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, i);`~~

    ```c
    13  Pthread_create(&tid[i], NULL, thread, (void *)i);
    22  int myid = (int)vargp;
    ```

- B.
    - Advantages:
        - Simple
        - Reduce overhead by eliminating the calls to `malloc` and `free`
    - Disadvantages:
        - Introduce the conversion between `int` and pointer, reduce the readablity of the code
        - It assumes that pointers are at least as large as `int`s
        - While this assumption is true for all modern systems, it might not be true for legacy or future systems
