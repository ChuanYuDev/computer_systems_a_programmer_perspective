# Practice Problem 12.9 (solution page 1038)
Let $p$ denote the number of producers, $c$ the number of consumers, and $n$ the buffer size in units of items. For each of the following scenarios, indicate whether the mutex semaphore in `sbuf_insert` and `sbuf_remove` is necessary or not.

A. $p = 1, c = 1, n > 1$

B. $p = 1, c = 1, n = 1$

C. $p > 1, c > 1, n = 1$

## Solution:
A. ~~No, `sbuf_insert` and `sbuf_remove` are not the same memory location~~
- Yes, the mutex semaphore is necessary because the producer and consumer can concurrently access the buffer

B. No
- A nonempty buffer is equivalent to a full buffer

- `sp->slots`, `sp->items` will ensure only one function has access to the butter
    - When the buffer contains an item, the producer is blocked

    - When the buffer is empty, the consumer is blocked

- So at any point in time, only a single thread can access the buffer, and thus mutual exclusion is guaranteed without using the mutex

C. No
- `sp->slots` makes sure ouly one producer has access to the butter
- `sp->items` makes sure only one consumer has access to the butter
