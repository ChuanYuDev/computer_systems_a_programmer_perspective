# Practice Problem 11.5 (solution page 969)
In Section 10.11, we warned you about the dangers of using the C standard I/O functions in network applications. Yet the CGI program in Figure 11.27 is able to use standard I/O without any problems. Why?

## Solution:
- The danger of using C standard I/O function in the network application occurs when we perform the output and input operation on the same socket descriptor simultaneously

- ~~For CGI program in Figure 11.27, there is only output operation~~
    - Wrong, because the standard I/O streams are full duplex

- The reason is that CGI program running in the child process does not need to perform `close` operation
- When the child process terminates, the kernel will close all the open file descriptors
