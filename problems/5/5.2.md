# Practice Problem 5.2 (solution page 573)
Later in this chapter we will start with a single function and generate many different variants that preserve the function's behavior, but with different performance characteristics. For three of these variants, we found that the run times (in clock cycles) can be approximated by the following functions:

Version 1: $60 + 35n$

Version 2: $136 + 4n$

Version 3: $157 + 1.25n$

For what values of $n$ would each version be the fastest of the three? Remember that $n$ will always be an integer.
