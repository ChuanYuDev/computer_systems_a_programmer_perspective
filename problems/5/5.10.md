# Practice Problem 5.10 (solution page 577)
As another example of code with potential load-store interactions, consider the following function to copy the contents of one array to another:

Suppose `a` is an array of length 1,000 initialized so that each element `a[i]` equals `i`.

A. What would be the effect of the call `copy_array(a+1, a, 999)`?

B. What would be the effect of the call `copy_array(a, a+1, 999)`?

C. Our performance measurements indicate that the call of part A has a CPE of 1.2 (which drops to 1.0 when the loop is unrolled by a factor of 4), while the call of part B has a CPE of 5.0. To what factor do you attribute this performance difference?

D. What performance would you expect for the call `copy_array(a, a, 999)`?
