# Practice Problem 5.12 (solution page 577)
Rewrite the code for `psum1` (Figure 5.1) so that it does not need to repeatedly retrieve the value of `p[i]` from memory. You do not need to use loop unrolling. We measured the resulting code to have a CPE of 3.00, limited by the latency of floating-point addition.
