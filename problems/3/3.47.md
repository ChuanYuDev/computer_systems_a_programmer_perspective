# Practice Problem 3.47 (solution page 347)
Running our stack-checking code 10,000 times on a system running Linux version 2.6.16, we obtained addresses ranging from a minimum of `0xffffb754` to a maximum of `0xffffd754`.

A. What is the approximate range of addresses?

B. If we attempted a buffer overrun with a 128-byte nop sled, about how many attempts would it take to test all starting addresses?
