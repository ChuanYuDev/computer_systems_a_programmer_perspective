# Practice Problem 2.49 (solution page 159)
A. For a floating-point format with an $n$-bit fraction, give a formula for the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly (because it would require an ($n + 1$)-bit fraction to be exact). Assume the exponent field size $k$ is large enough that the range of representable exponents does not provide a limitation for this problem.

В. What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format ($n =23$)?
